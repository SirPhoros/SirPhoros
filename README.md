### Hello world 💻
I am Cristóbal (he/they), a junior full-stack developer finding their place in the lively and technological community. Always learning and willing to improve our society.

##⚡ Fun facts about me ⚡
- I started coding in high-school, with C/C++. I self learned most of it, and I created my first text-base game. After that, I gave it a try to C# in Unity and Python. 
- I have a background in Linguistics, Languages and Literature (degree in English Studies); however, I've been always more attracted to the scientific side of humanities. How we can collect data from humar phenomena and see if there is any logic pattern to it. 
- I am from South Spain, more especifically Granada, in Andalusia; however, at the moment I am living in Manchester, UK. 
- In 2022, I gave it a try to coding again, with an Udemy course, and after that I joined Northcoders for their 13 weeks bootcamp.
